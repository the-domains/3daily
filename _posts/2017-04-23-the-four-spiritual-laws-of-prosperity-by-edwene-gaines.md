### The Four Spiritual Laws of Prosperity by Edwene Gaines

Prosperity includes the following:

- a **vitally alive physical body** to provide a comfortable worldly home for the spiritual beings that we are;

- **relationships** that are satisfying, nurturing, honest and work all the time;

- **work that we love** so much that it's not work, it's play; and

- all the **money** we can spend.
