### The Four Spiritual Laws of Prosperity by Edwene Gaines

_Prosperity includes the following:_

- a vitally alive physical body to provide a comfortable worldly home for the spiritual beings that we are;

- relationships that are satisfying, nurturing, honest and work all the time; 

- work that we love so much that it's not work, it's play; and

- all the money we can spend.
