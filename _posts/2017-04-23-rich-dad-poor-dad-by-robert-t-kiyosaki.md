### Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki

> The rich don't work for money. The rich have money work for them. 

> People's lives are forever controlled by two emotions: fear and greed. 

> Often in the real world, it's not the smart who get ahead, but the bold.

**There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal.**
